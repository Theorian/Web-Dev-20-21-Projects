        My name is Caleb Dredge and I am very interested in helping out aspiring
        best that they possibly can be which is why I
       call is a website that let's musicians get the equipment they need
       find inspiring artists, and release their own music

      I am very inspired by other bands and people that want to help out their
      community. I wanted to make music myself and wanted a place where I can
      listen to artists that inspire me as well as find recommended instruments.
      I really hope my website becomes functional and most of all useful

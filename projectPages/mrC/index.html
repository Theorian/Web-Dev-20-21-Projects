        With this social network marketers and end users can obtain a massive
        amount of real-time data that is void of any marketing spin. A.I.
        systems will be able to run analytics which uncover the key insight from
        all the data collected. These insights can be tailored to the end user
        and their demographics to improve ROI.
      </p>
      All content and media shared on this ecosystem will receive real time
      validation and exposure via the three main sources: - Blockchain based
      cryptocurrencies are awarded to users info that create higher rates of
      exposure. - Paying users to watch video ads, answer surveys, and complete
      micro-tasks. - Marketing-grade data for companies looking to reach more
      detailed demographics. The result is a revenue-generating content and
      media creation platform that has already been shown to monetize media at
      93% profit margins. And for the users? A social network unlike any other
      where users are compensated for the information they give - the first of
      its kind.
